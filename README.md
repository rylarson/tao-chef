# Using Chef and Vagrant to create build, development, and test environments.

### Abstract
Go beyond automated tests into automated environments. Learn the nuts and bolts of how to fully automate the provisioning of build and test environments through the story of how it was done at Tripwire. When build, development, and test environments are defined as code, they can be versioned along with the software that they support. This allows truly reproducible tests and builds by controlling and versioning changes to the test and build environments.
