### Abstract



Motivation: Efficiency saves money and versioning allows infrastructure to be extremely flexible.

Problem statement: Expensive manual repetitive environment setup and unreproducible builds. 

Approach: How did you go about solving or making progress on the problem? Did you use simulation, analytic models, prototype construction, or analysis of field data for an actual product?

Results: What's the answer?

Conclusions: What are the implications of your answer? Is it going to change the world (unlikely), be a significant "win", be a nice hack, or simply serve as a road sign indicating that this path is a waste of time (all of the previous results are useful)?
